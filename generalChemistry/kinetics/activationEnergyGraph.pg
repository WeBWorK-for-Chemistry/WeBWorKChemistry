$alt0 = "Image shows a graph with reaction coordinate labeled on the x-axis and E labeled on the y-axis.  A curved line starts near the origin 
that slopes upwards quickly, reaches a peak, and drops quickly to level out horizontally at a y-value that is ABOVE above the starting y-value.
The start point is labeled A. The peak is labeled B and the end point is labeled E.  A tall vertical arrow labeled C directly under the peak starts at the 
lowest y-value and ends pointing at the peak. A second small vertical arrow labeled F under the end position starts from the initial y-value and 
ends pointing at the end position.  A third medium vertical arrow labeled D starts from the end point and ends at an y-value that is level with the peak height.";

On the previous reaction profile, find the letter marker that indicates the:

1. position of reactants  [_]{$popup0}
2. position of products [_]{$popup1}
3. the activation energy for the forward reaction, [` E_{A,{forward}} `] [_]{$popup2}
4. the activation energy for the reverse reaction, [` E_{A,{reverse}} `] [_]{$popup3}
5. the change in enthalpy for the reaction, [` \Delta H `] [_]{$popup4}

6. Which of the following would best represent the values of the rate constants for the forward and reverse reaction?
