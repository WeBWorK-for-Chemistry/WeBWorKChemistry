##Measuring with a Ruler of Various Precision

_Measure the strip of magnesium above each ruler.  Include the measurement with the correct number of signigficant digits and uncertainty for the units shown (centimeters).  Place the measurement and uncertainty *in separate boxes* in the answer field.  You will need to carefully look at the markings on the ruler.  The first example has been done for you._

Example: [@ image( "ruler9.png", width=>516, height=>225,extra_html_tags=>"alt='gray rectangle starts at 0 cm and ends exactly on the 5th small mark after the 5 cm mark'"  )@]*

    The magnesium strip above measures *5.50* +/- *0.01* cm.


a)  [@ image( $image0, width=>516, height=>225,  
 extra_html_tags=>"alt='$alt0'"  )@]*


The magnesium strip above measures [____]{$m0} +/- [___]{$m0uncert} cm.


b)  [@ image( $image1, width=>516, height=>225,  
 extra_html_tags=>"alt='$alt1'"  )@]*
 

    The magnesium strip above measures [____]{$m1} +/- [___]{$m1uncert} cm.
