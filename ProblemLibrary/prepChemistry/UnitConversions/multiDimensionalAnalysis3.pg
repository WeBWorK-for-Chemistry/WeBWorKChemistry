## Unit Conversion - Two Step

*Convert [$given] to pm. Go through the base unit.*

The given value has been placed into the single line of dimensional analysis for you. Place the correct conversion factors into the problem. Remember to look at the units to know which conversion factor to use. For two step metric conversions convert the given unit to the base unit (meters, liters, grams, etc) and then convert the base unit to the desired unit. 

[#
    [.[`[$given]`] .]
    [.[`\times`].]

    [.
        [#
            [.[_]{$ma} .]*{bottom => 1}
            [.[_]{$ma} .]*
        #]*
    .]

    [.[`\times`].]

    [.
        [#
            [.[_]{$ma} .]*{bottom => 1}
            [.[_]{$ma} .]*
        #]*
    .]
    [.[`=`].]
    [.[_]{$ma}.]
#]*{valign => 'middle'}

# This weights the final answer with X percentage and splits the rest among the conversion factors.
my $finalAnswerWeight = 50;
my $remain = 100-$finalAnswerWeight;
my @ansArr = $ma->cmp();
my $finalAns = pop @ansArr;
for ($i=0; $i<scalar @ansArr; $i++){
	WEIGHTED_ANS($ansArr[$i], $remain/(scalar @ansArr)); # sets weighting for dimensional analysis blanks
}
WEIGHTED_ANS($finalAns, $finalAnswerWeight); # sets weighting for final answer

# Without weighting, you could simply use this:
# ANS($ma->cmp);
# each answer blank will be worth the same amount of points.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

The general steps in performing dimensional analysis

1.  Identify the "given" information in the problem. Look for a number with units to start this problem with.
2.  What is the problem asking you to "find"? In other words, what unit will your answer have?
3.  Use ratios and conversion factors to cancel out the units that aren't part of your answer, and leave you with units that are part of your answer.
4.  When your units cancel out correctly, you are ready to do the math. You are multiplying fractions, so you multiply the top numbers and divide by the bottom numbers in the fractions.

Please Note: If you get feedback that the answer is fractionally correct you likely have issues with significant figures in your answer. The conversion factor is considered incorrect unless both the numerator and denominator is scored as correct. If one of these is incorrect look at the entire conversion factor for corrections.
