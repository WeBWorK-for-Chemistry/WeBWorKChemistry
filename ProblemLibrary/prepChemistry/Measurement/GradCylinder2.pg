##Measuring with a Graduated Cylinder

_Measure the amount of liquid in each graduated cylinder below.  Include the measurement with the correct number of signigficant digits and uncertainty for the precision. Place the measurement and uncertainty *in separate boxes* in the answer field._

a)  [@ image( $image0, width=>105, height=>330,  
 extra_html_tags=>"alt='$alt0'"  )@]*

    The amount of liquid in the graduated cylinder above is [____]{$m0} +/- [___]{$m0uncert} mL.


b)  [@ image( $image1, width=>105, height=>330,  
 extra_html_tags=>"alt='$alt1'"  )@]*
 
    The amount of liquid in the graduated cylinder above is [____]{$m1} +/- [___]{$m1uncert} mL.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

1. When measuring liquid that has a menicus, always read from the bottom of the curve. 

2. What is the quantity measured by the smallest lines on the graduated cylinder in these examples? In other words, how far apart are these markings?

        a. [$tick0] mL
    
        b. [$tick1] mL

    This means that the measurement for these devices should be *one digit more precise* than this. This is called the guess digit and this will define the uncertainty for that measurement.
