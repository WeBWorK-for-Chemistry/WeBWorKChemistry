##Stoichiometry: Moles to Moles

Calculate the number of moles of [``\mathrm{HCl}``] are consumed when [``\mathrm{[$given]}``] is reacted, according to the chemical equation given. Be sure to include units [``\mathrm{(mol\ HCl)}``] and report your answer with the correct number of significant figures. 
    

[``` \ce{2 HCl(aq) + Na_2CO_3(aq) \rightarrow  H_2O(l) + CO_2(g) + 2 NaCl(aq)} ```]

[@ DimensionalAnalysis::generateProblem($given,[ans_rule(10),ans_rule(10)],ans_rule(10)) @]*

END_PGML


# This weights the final answer with X percentage and splits the rest among the conversion factors.
my $finalAnswerWeight = 50;
my $remain = 100-$finalAnswerWeight;
my @ansArr = $ma->cmp();
my $finalAns = pop @ansArr;
for ($i=0; $i<scalar @ansArr; $i++){
	WEIGHTED_ANS($ansArr[$i], $remain/(scalar @ansArr)); # sets weighting for dimensional analysis blanks
}
WEIGHTED_ANS($finalAns, $finalAnswerWeight); # sets weighting for final answer

# Without weighting, you could simply use this:
# ANS($ma->cmp);
# each answer blank will be worth the same amount of points.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT

The general steps in performing dimensional analysis

1.  Identify the "given" information in the problem. Look for a number with units to start this problem with.
2.  What is the problem asking you to "find"? In other words, what unit will your answer have?
3.  Use ratios and conversion factors to cancel out the units that aren't part of your answer, and leave you with units that are part of your answer.
4.  When your units cancel out correctly, you are ready to do the math. You are multiplying fractions, so you multiply the top numbers and divide by the bottom numbers in the fractions.
