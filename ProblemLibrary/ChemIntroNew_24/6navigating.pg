## Navigating WeBWorK ##
By now you've had experience with the "Next Problem" button. The "Previous Problem" button takes you to the previous
problem, and the "Problem List" button takes you to a listing of all problems in the set.

At the bottom of a problem screen, you can see how many times you have attempted a problem, and how many attempts you
have left. Sometimes you also see whether or not partial credit is possible, and if so how much do you have. This
particular problem is lying about how many attempts you have used. How many attempts does it _say_ that you have used
so far? [_]{$a}{4}

To the left of the screen there are some panels. The top panel lets you find your way to the following, although
depending on how your course is set up, any of these pages might not be available.
* *Assignments*: this is the "home" screen where you can see all of the assignments that have been assigned to you and
when they are due.
* *Account Settings*: at this page you may (or may not) be able to change things like your password, your email address,
how math is rendered for you, whether or not your previous answers will be visible to you, and whether or not you want
to use the math editing tool. Some of these things may not be available depending on how your instructor or institution
has configured WeBWorK.
* *Grades*: go here to see how you have performed in your assignments.
* *Achievements*: if your instructor is using Achievements, then you can earn badges and level up as you complete
homework problems. Go here to view your level and badges. Also, if you have earned any items that can be applied to
your homework sets, you will see them here.
