$MathJax = <<END_BODY;
Math content like the following expression is rendered using MathJax.

[```\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}```]

Each piece of math content is tab-indexed, meaning that by using the tab key, you can bring the web browser's focus to
that piece of content. Try clicking your mouse on the title of this page ("Interacting with Math") and then use the tab
key. Under default conditions, you should see an indication that the web browser is now focused on the math expression.

Once focus is on a math expression, using the space bar will activate the "MathJax menu". You can also activate this menu
by right-clicking (Windows/Linux) or [|control|]*-clicking (MacOS) a piece of math. Try activating the MathJax menu now.
It should look like the following.

There are many features that help you to engage with math content. Explore the menu options to survey what is available.

We will now point out a few important features. In the main menu, there is a "Math Settings" submenu. The "Zoom Trigger"
and "Zoom Factor" items allow you to control if/how math content is magnified. Magnification may help users with some
vision disabilities see the content better. And it may help all users to see some details of math notation better. Take
a moment to explore these settings and select options that you would be comfortable with. (Of course you can change
these settings at any time.)

Also in the main menu, there is an "Accessibility" submenu. In that menu, if accessibility is not already activated,
select "Activate". After activating this, you may need to refresh the web page to see the math expression again. Now you
have the option to see math content verbalized. To do this, place focus onto a math expression and hit [|enter|]*.
* At first, the entire expression is highlighted and there will be a verbal rendering of the expression.  
[!Speech string for the quadratic formula!]{'explorerfull.png'}{600}
* Use the down arrow to navigate "down" into a smaller piece of the math expression.
* Use the left/right arrows to navigate to similar pieces of the math expression.
* At any time you can navigate back "up" to a larger part of the expression, or "down" into smaller pieces. For example,
you can see a verbalization for just this part of the expression above:  
[!Speech string for the radicand of the quadratic formula!]{'explorerpiece.png'}{600} 
* Return to the MathJax menu, Accessibility submenu, to explore options for how this explorer tool works.
* Under "Speech" you will find options to use MathSpeak, ClearSpeak, or ChromeVox rules. The default is to use
"MathSpeak verbose" rules, which try try to read math "literally" without context. For example, it reads [`(1,3)`] as
"left parenthesis 1 comma 3 right parenthesis". Other speech rules can produce more meaningful verbal renderings. For
example with the right ClearSpeak settings, the same math expression produces "the point with coordinates 1 comma 3"
or "the interval from 1 to 3 not including 1 or 3". 

Some keyboard-navigating users might find it undesirable for each piece of math content to be tab-indexed. If this is
the case, then in the "Accessibility" sub menu you can uncheck "Include in Tab Order". Just note that in order to undo
this and make math content tabbable again, you will need to access the menu, and so you will need some way other than
tabbing to bring focus back to a piece of math content.
END_BODY

$images = <<END_BODY;
Math content like the following expression is rendered using images.

[```\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}```]

Each piece of math content is a small PNG image file. There is not much that you can do to interact with these images.
In Account Settings, you might be able to change "View equations as:" to "MathJax". Then reloading this problem will
show you way to engage with math content. If you do not find "MathJax" as an option, then it may be disabled for this
course.
END_BODY

$plainText = <<END_BODY;
Math content like the following expression is rendered as plain text.

[```\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}```]

Each piece of math content is LaTeX code that could be used to render a math expression. There is not much that you can
do to interact with this code. In Account Settings, you might be able to change "View equations as:" to "MathJax". Then
reloading this problem will show you way to engage with math content. If you do not find "MathJax" as an option, then it
may be disabled for this course.

## Interacting with Math

This page will primarily be of interest to users with accessibility needs. However, all users might learn math more
easily by learning about the tools that are described here.
